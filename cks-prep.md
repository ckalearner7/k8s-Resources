Start your preparations now!

In order to take the CKS exam, you must hold a current CKA certification to demonstrate you possess sufficient Kubernetes expertise. If you want to make sure you are ready for the CKS and have not already achieved the CKA, we encourage you to start today! We provide a wealth of resources to help you prepare for CKA.

The details

CKS is similar in format to CKA and will consist of a performance-based certification exam â€“ testing competence across best practices for securing container-based applications and Kubernetes platforms during build, deployment, and runtime. 

The new certification is designed to enable cloud native professionals to demonstrate security skills to current and potential employers. The exam will test domains and competencies including:

Cluster Setup
Cluster Hardening
System Hardening
Minimize Microservice Vulnerabilities
Supply Chain Security
Monitoring, Logging, and Runtime Security
The certification is expected to be generally available before the KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America Virtual event taking place November 17-20.
