This README will guide you on your Kubernetes journey with the aim of getting certified in Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) and Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)
If you plan to do both your certifications, I strongly recommend you prep for CKAD first, followed by CKA.

Pre-requisites
- Basic knowledge of linux and vi (or nano)
- tmux or screen, if you want multiple screens ( I used it in practise but did not use it for the exams)
- Basic knowledge of docker and containers - what is a container, docker commands such as ps, stop, logs, kill

Training Course
Stay with Mumshad Mannambeth course of Udemy - links below.  These courses are on sale for $12.99 to $14.99 so wait for a day or two before buying it at actual list price

3. https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/

Do all the practise tests (atleast 2-3 times) that are referenced in the above, they help you give a solid base.

For the exams hosted by CNCF, purchase them at
https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/
https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/

Again, I was told that these go on sale, normally priced at $300.  During November BlackFriday, I have heard of 50% sale, so wait!!  Use the next 2-months to prep for the certification and then buy at the right time

Practice, Practise, Practise!!
This is not a multiple choice question and answer exam, this is real hands-on, which is what makes learning and doing exciting!
Practise is the only way to succeed.  Even though this exam is an open book, as in, you can have 1 tab of your chrome browser (well remind me of this later) with access to kubernetes.io documentation, please know all of the commands.  With the exception of creating PV, PVCs, I did not use the documentation during the exam

To create a cluster, use the following URLs
1. Download and install virtual box
2. Download and install vagrant
3. Ubuntu Vagrant for deploying K8S cluster
   a. https://github.com/LocusInnovations/k8s-vagrant-virtualbox
4. CentOS Vagrant for deploying K8S cluster
   a. https://github.com/justmeandopensource/kubernetes
5. If you dont have a terminal software such as SecureCRT, you can use the chrome SSH plug-in. I found this handy, and used it for my practise

Finally, for practise - for CKAD, use the following links
1. https://codeburst.io/kubernetes-ckad-weekly-challenges-overview-and-tips-7282b36a2681
2. https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises
3. https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/practice-enough-with-these-questions-for-the-ckad-exam-2f42d1228552


For CKA, use the link that Giri and I created (well, we are proud of it) since none existed for CKA before:
1. https://levelup.gitconnected.com/kubernetes-cka-example-questions-practical-challenge-86318d85b4d 
2. https://github.com/gvgiri/k8s-Resources/blob/master/cka-exam-prep.md


Prior to the exam, you can also purchase CKAD and CKA practise exams at killer.sh (for $29.99 Euro, each, well worth it, again, wait for a SALE!)


During the exam (reference to Chrome Browser),
1. I started the CKAD exam, and my chrome browser hung, as in the exam window was not able to show me the exam
2. I had to install Vivaldi browser
3. Import my bookmarks

Suggest, you do 2 and 3 prior to the exam, so you are ready, just in case!

For CKA exam, my chrome browser worked, but I was ready with 2 and 3 above.
